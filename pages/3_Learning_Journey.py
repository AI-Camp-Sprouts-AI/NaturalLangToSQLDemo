## Learning Journey

This project was a great learning experience for our team. We learned how to work together effectively, divide tasks, and help each other out when needed. We also gained valuable experience in Python programming, natural language processing, and PostgreSQL.

In the final few weeks of the project, we focused on developing the Python package and integrating all the components. We also spent a lot of time testing and refining our package to ensure it works as expected.

## Next Steps

Now that our project is complete, we are excited to demonstrate it to you. You can interact with our chatbot, see how it interprets your natural language input, and watch as it executes PostgreSQL commands based on your input.

We are also looking forward to receiving your feedback and suggestions. We believe there is always room for improvement, and we are eager to learn and grow from this experience.

Thank you for taking the time to visit our project dashboard. We hope you find our project interesting and useful.
